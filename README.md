# SQL-Challenge
UTSA Data Analytics Bootcamp SQL challenge where employee data from .csv files will be analyzed using SQL queries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EMPLOYEESQL

Inside the SQL-Challenge Repository there is a Resources folder containing six .csv files that are used to populate created SQL tables in PGAdmin 4. File names correspond to the created SQL tables. 

Within the EmployeeSQL folder, there are two different .sql files and a ERD_employee.png file. The ERD_employee file is an image file depicting a created Entity Relationship Diagram (created using QuickDBD) of our tables created from the given .csv files.

The employee_data.sql file contains sql code that is used to define tables with necessary primary keys, foreign key relationships, and data types for each given .csv file. Data from each corresponding file can then be imported into the corresponding tables with no errors to view and query the data in PGAdmin 4.

The employee_queries.sql file contains sql code that runs multiple queries to organize the data tables based on requested information and filter parameters.
